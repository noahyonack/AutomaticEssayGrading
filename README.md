# AutomaticEssayGrading
Grading essays, but automatically.

Building a statistical model to automatically grade essays. Grading essays by hand is slow and expensive, so teachers turn to less time-consuming, less-effective methods, like multiple choice tests. Let's bring essays back to the classroom.

This project is inspired by a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes/data) hosted by The Hewlett Foundation.
